## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or above.

```sh
npm install --save cypress-svelte-unit-test
npm install --save-dev @cypress/webpack-preprocessor
```

## Use

* Import your component and mount function from this module
* Mount your component
* Start testing using [Cypress commands](https://on.cypress.io/api)

```js
import Counter from '../components/Counter.html'
import mount from 'cypress-svelte-unit-test'
describe('count', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    mount(Counter)
  })
  it('shows 0', () => {
    cy.contains('Count: 0')
  })
})
```

The `mount` function returns a promise which resolves to the current document. At the same time, the instance of the mounted component is available from `Cypress.component` for further interaction. Assuming that your component has a value item in its `data`:

```js
mount(InputText, {value: ''}).then((doc) =>			
  Cypress.component.observe('value', (val) =>
    // ... called for any change to value
  )
)
```

## Examples

* Counter [component](cypress/components/Counter.html) and [test](cypress/integration/counter-spec.js)
* Users [component](cypress/components/Users.html) and [test](cypress/integration/users-spec.js) shows XHR spying and stubbing

## Details

* uses Webpack + [svelte-loader](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader)
* see [cypress/plugins/index.js](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-svelte-unit-test/blob/master/cypress/plugins/index.js) for the necessary plugin setup of `@cypress/webpack-preprocessor`
